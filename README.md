This repository contains a Solidity smart contract with a bug in the balanceOf function and its corrected version. The original balanceOf function does not perform a check to see if the account exists in the balances mapping before returning its balance. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities if an attacker attempts to query the balance of a non-existent account.  The corrected version addresses this issue, providing a more robust and secure implementation.
